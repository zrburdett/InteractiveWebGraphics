# InteractiveWebGraphics

## Description
I plan on making the three different illustrations interactive by changing the colors and shapes based on mouse location and clicking the mouse inside the browser window.

### First Screen
For the first image, it will be a blank canvas but when the user clicks the mouse button, a circle will be created with a random color stroke. The circle will then expand outwards and eventually become too big to see on the canvas.

### Second Screen
For the second image, it will be a simple bird logo standing on a tree branch. As the user moves the mouse around, the background color will change and if the user clicks the mouse button, the bird itself will change color.

### Third Screen
For the third image, several shapes will be falling from the top of the screen and if the user clicks the mouse button, the shape will change from a square to a circle or triangle. The color of the shapes can also change based on the location of the mouse within the browser window.

### Necessary Tools
I plan on using Canvas to accomplish this, as it is easy to add animation to the objects created with it.
