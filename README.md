# InteractiveWebGraphics

## Description
I plan on making the three different illustrations interactive by changing the colors and shapes based on mouse location and clicking the mouse inside the browser window.

### First Screen
For the first image, it will be a blank canvas but when the user clicks the mouse button, a circle will be created with a random color stroke. The circle will then expand outwards and eventually become too big to see on the canvas.

### Second Screen
For the second image, it will be a simple bird logo standing on a tree branch. As the user moves the mouse around, the background color will change and if the user clicks the mouse button, the bird itself will change color.

### Third Screen
For the third image, several shapes will be falling from the top of the screen and if the user clicks the mouse button, the shape will change from a square to a circle or triangle. The color of the shapes can also change based on the location of the mouse within the browser window.

### Necessary Tools
I plan on using Canvas to accomplish this, as it is easy to add animation to the objects created with it.

## Final Thoughts
I originally thought I would use Canvas to accomplish the vector graphic portions of this project but I found that using the SVG file for my complex rook logo worked just fine and the shapes on the other pages could be easily created using just HTML and CSS styling.

After some trial and error, I was not able to get the circles for the first screen to grow as originally intended. I also edited the goal of the third screen by making the shapes move up and down across the screen rather than always falling as I did not want to keep adding many many shapes onto the window, which could possibly cause issues with users that are using slower and older computers.
